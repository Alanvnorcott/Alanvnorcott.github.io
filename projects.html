                    <p>ClickCount is my first deployed web app; It is a web stats tracker formatted much like a videogame. I built this to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and familiarize myself with Google's APIs. I had fun creating this small application and hope to push the needle further with each consecutive project. It is now on the Chrome store for download, so feel free to try it out and let me know what you think or if there are any issues. I plan to add more to this project and continually refine it as I start my next one.</p>

                <div id="project3" class="project-info hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p>AICast was built via the use of Python and libraries like Tensor and Numpy, I have developed an artificial intelligence system that can learn via reinforcement learning methods. I wrote the basic scripts that defined the behaviors and interactions of four different "tribes" in the simulation. I also used learning visualization tools to track and evaluate the progress of my learning. Updates and improvements are still being made to this project in order to improve its efficacy and functionality. </p>

                <div id="project4" class="project-info hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p>NetScan is a Python project that I used to leverage my understanding of network configuration and security, as well as my proficiencies with Python. This script allows you to run a diagnostic of your network's IP, your machine's IP, or a custom IP of your choice. The scans included are: open port scanning, vulnerability scanning (via the CVE vulnerabilities database JSON file), network devices scan (ARP), ICMP sweeping, network traffic analysis (with packet capture file), and banner grabbing. I am hoping to create an appealing front end to this script as well but for the time being it must be utilized via the console. Most of these commands require administrator-level access, so if you decide to run this yourself keep that in mind. </p>

                <div id="project5" class="project-info hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p>This here is my pixel game demo. I put in roughly 30 hours of work and have created numerous scripts.  I worked with many variations of scripts that are attached to different aspects of a collision, NPC scripts, combat scripts, and well as quest and level progression scripts. I utilized Unity for the engine and scripted with C#</p>

                    <p>Budgetr is a Flutter app that asks about the user's employment status, income, expenses, etc. Based on the user's answers, the user is presented with some predictions about future income, and recommendations for success. Additionally, a admin login is also present which brings the user to a database based on other user input.</p>

                <div id="project7" class="project-info hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p>As part of a team of five, We developed a web application aimed at sorting cross-listed courses. The project involved configuring a database to parse and store information about all the courses offered. To implement the application, I worked within the Flask framework, leveraging my skills in Python, HTML, and CSS. This experience allowed me to collaborate effectively with my teammates and apply my programming knowledge to create a functional and user-friendly web application for managing and organizing cross-listed courses. </p>
